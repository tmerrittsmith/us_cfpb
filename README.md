# US Consumer FInancial Protection Bureau

As an intermediary, the CFPB receives a large number of complaints. To help the CFPB better manage them, they would like to reduce the complaints logged to those that are most likely to be successful. To help them to do this, they would like to be able to indicate to a consumer whether it is likely that their complaint will be accepted. This will help the consumer to decide whether they wish to go through the complaints process, and will reduce the number of complaints logged.

Therefore, your objective is to build a classification model that can be used to:

   1. Determine whether a consumer's complaint will be accepted and whether they are likely to receive relief.
   2. Help the CFPB understand what factors affect how a company responds to the complaints that it receives.

I've included two notebooks here: 

* US CFPB task is my solution for the task above. I ended up using Logistic Regression for its interpretable output, as well as doing some exploratory data analysis.

* nn_classification includes a series of neural network approaches for text classification, with and without hyperparameters.
